# Water.io

A MERN stack based webapp to help the farmers and government officials decide on irrigation facilities based on the ground water level predictions. The ground water level forecasting was done using Time Series Analysis in Python, with the final model running at an accuracy of 90%. Along with the groundwater level forecasting, other factors like number of active tubewells were also predicted.
